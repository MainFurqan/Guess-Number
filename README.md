# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

## Description
The **Number Guessing Game** is a fun and interactive game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated target number. 

### How It Works:
- When you start the game, a **target number** is automatically generated in the background.
- You will enter your guesses, and the game will provide feedback:
  - If your guessed number is **less** than the target, you'll see a message indicating it's **too low**.
  - If your guessed number is **greater** than the target, you'll see a message indicating it's **too high**.
  - If you guess the number correctly, you'll see a message celebrating your **successful guess**!
